Description: This package performs variable selection with Second Generation P Values. 
    The one-stage algorithm is extremely fast and the two-stage algorithm has lower 
    parameter estimation bias when data are highly correlated. S3 method 'predict' is 
    available for both algorithms, and S3 method 'plot' is available for the two-stage algorithm.
